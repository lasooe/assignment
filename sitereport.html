      <h2>Web Development Journey</h2>
      <p>Over the course of this term, I embarked on learning the basics of web development, diving into coding, design principles, and the debugging process. Initially, I had limited knowledge, but through consistent practice and troubleshooting, I gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in building websites.</p>

      <h3>Learning Experience: Coding, Design, and Debugging</h3>
      <p>The journey started with basic HTML and CSS. I was both excited and overwhelmed as I learned how to structure a webpage, style elements, and add interactivity. HTML felt intuitive at first, but as I got into more complex layouts, I encountered difficulties with positioning elements and ensuring responsiveness. CSS, while flexible, posed its own challenges, particularly when it came to fine-tuning design elements such as fonts, colors, and margins.</p>
      <p>One of the most frustrating parts was debugging. At first, I struggled with minor mistakes—like missing closing tags or incorrect class names—that caused layout issues or broken functionality. The browser’s developer tools became a lifesaver as I learned to inspect elements and trace errors. The trial and error process was sometimes exhausting, but each bug I fixed felt like a victory, making the website a bit more functional and polished.</p>

      <h3>Development of the Site</h3>
      <p>My website evolved significantly throughout the term. Initially, I focused on getting the basic structure and content in place, but over time, I spent more effort on refining the user interface (UI). I decided on a minimalist design to keep the focus on the content, choosing the “Poppins” font for a modern, clean look and using a color scheme inspired by nature—muted greens and blues—for a calm, inviting feel.</p>
      <p>I was influenced by sites like <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind Css</a>, which had clean layouts, easy navigation, and strong visual hierarchy. These sites helped me understand how design elements could enhance user experience.</p>

      <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>For the font, I chose “Poppins” for its modern and legible style, and for colors, I used #4CAF50 (green) and #2196F3 (blue) to create contrast while maintaining a soothing tone. The color choices also aimed to be accessible for users with different visual abilities.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion and Reflections</h3>
      <p>Looking back, I can confidently say that my skills have grown immensely over the term. While the coding and debugging process was challenging at times, it was incredibly rewarding to see my website come to life. The design decisions I made were driven by a desire to keep things simple yet functional, ensuring a positive user experience. The journey also taught me patience and persistence, as each problem solved led to more refined and polished work.</p>
